### About this repository
This repository contains codes related to the study of neural networks and some tests related to the operation of Tucker decomposition. The codes were developed using the Keras and PyTorch frameworks for training the neural networks, and MatPlotLib framework for data visualization. The TensorLy framework was used for operations involving tensor decomposition.
